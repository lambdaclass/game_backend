## Setup

Disabled Hyperthreading:

```bash
# If active, this returns 1
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/active
# Turn off hyperthreading
echo off | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control
```

Increased the time the matching coordinator waits before launching the game
(`@start_game_timeout_ms`). This is to ensure that if we spawn 50 clients, we
get 5 games with 10 players each.

## Tests

These were ran using an AMD ryzen 3600 with 6 physical cores

We'll be running tests while we also try to play with the app to see if there
is a noticeable downgrade on the UX. We'll run using
`LoadTest.PlayerSupervisor.spawn_players(NUMBER_OF_USERS, PLAY_TIME)` where
PLAY_TIME is the amount in seconds the players play before closing the
connection.

- NUMBER_OF_USERS = 20, PLAY_TIME = 120 = 2min (should be coupled into 2 games of 10 players)
- NUMBER_OF_USERS = 50, PLAY_TIME = 120 = 2min (should be coupled into 5 games of 10 players)
- NUMBER_OF_USERS = 150, PLAY_TIME = 180 = 3min (should be coupled into 15 games of 10 players)
- NUMBER_OF_USERS = 300, PLAY_TIME = 240 = 4min (should be coupled into 30 games of 10 players)
- NUMBER_OF_USERS = 600, PLAY_TIME = 300 = 5min (should be coupled into 60 games of 10 players)

## Test Results

### NUMBER_OF_USERS = 20, PLAY_TIME = 120
Good UX

Both during ~40-50% CPU and 80-90% CPU the UX was still good, I didn't see any warping nor sudden updates, or the game slowing down

We didn't keep up with the next cases as it was already getting to 100% CPU

## Profiling

Since there was a high cpu usage we resorted to profiling to see if we can find the cause of it.

### Eprof

We ran the load test with NUMBER_OF_USERS = 30 PLAY_TIME = 120 and ran:

```elixir
:eprof.start()
:eprof.start_profiling([DarkWorldsServer.Matchmaking])
# wait a few seconds for games to start
:eprof.stop_profiling()
:eprof.analyze(:total, [{:sort, :time}])
```

the most consuming ones were:

We did the same thing but with `:eprof.start_profiling([DarkWorldsServer.Engine.EngineRunner])` and got:

### Etop

NUMBER_OF_USERS=30 PLAY_TIME = 120

with NUMBER_OF_USERS=100 PLAY_TIME = 240 the messages queues started to get clogged:

### fprof and qcachegrind

NUMER_OF_USERS=30 PLAY_TIME = 120
We generated a `.cgrind` trace you can open with qcachegrind

## Measures taken

As per Fede's suggestion, we removed the dirty schedulers from the nif
functions. The reason behind it came because of the observation that CPU usage
spiked when the amount of games was around 7. Since the server used to run the
load test had 6 physical cores, and each dirty scheduler takes an entire core
each, the remaining processes had to fight for a free core. 

To test this hypothesis, we removed all the `#[rustler::nif(schedule = "DirtyCpu")]` 
from the rust code and re-did the load test. With that we were able to handle up 
to 500 users or about 50 (some games ended before others started but it was still 
around 50) concurrent games of 10 players each in the same server while getting only 
40-50% CPU usage.
